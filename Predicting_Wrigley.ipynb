        "Can the weather be used to predict, or at least explain, the total number of runs scored in a baseball game at Wrigley Field? [Warm weather has long been known to favor batters](https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/5-ways-weather-is-pivotal-in-a-baseball-game/349548), as the ball travels farther in the heat. In addition, Wrigley Field's location just a few blocks to the west of Lake Michigan subjects it to the same volatile wind conditions as the rest of Chicago. The wind can serve as a blessing or a curse to batters depending on whether it helps carry the batted ball out of the park or fights against its trajectory.\n",
        "\n",
        "To build a data set, I joined lakefront weather records collected by the City of Chicago to MLB game records. Then, I fitted and evaluated regression, random forest, and neural network models to determine which method was most accurate by measuring the mean absolute error. I discovered that even though the weather conditions are poor predictors of total runs scored in a game, multilinear regression can account for 5.9% of the variance in scoring. Furthermore, its predictions outperformed the machine learning models."

Northeast, east or southeast winds are frequent, especially during the spring months when air over the lake tends to be colder than temperatures over land. The prevalence of northeast winds varies in the Chicago area, with northeast winds most frequent along the lakefront. There, northeast winds blow, on average, about 40 percent of the time.\""

In addition, regression models have the advantage of being more easily interpretable because I know how the predictions are calculated."

        "Was I able to successfully predict the score at Wrigley based on weather conditions? The answer is relative. An MAE between between 3.633-3.910 runs is not exactly precise when the standard deviation of the whole dataset is 4.716 runs. The neural network, in particular, was disappointing because it failed to consider the weather data when making predictions and just hugged the median of 8 runs.\n",

        "That being said, I was trying to predict baseball, a sport that is notoriously unpredictable, without using baseball data, only the weather. The regression model did successfully quantify how weather can influence the game in a way that makes intuitive sense. Rising temperatures along with favorable winds from the west or south increase total runs. In terms of explanatory power, it is quite remarkable that the weather can account for 5.9% of the variance in run scoring.\n",
        "\n",
        "The impact of the weather on Wrigley Field is real and measurable. If you show up there on a summery day with the wind blowing out of the park from the west, you might want to take the over bet on the total number of runs scored. Just don't hold me accountable."
