# Wrigley
I used weather sensor data from Chicago's lakefront to predict the total number of runs scored during Cubs games at Wrigley Field. This supervised learning study compares the accuracy of multilinear regression, random forest, and neural netowrk models.

Beach_Weather_Stations_-_Automated_Sensors.csv: This csv contains the lakefront weather data taken from the City of Chicago's data portal.

games.csv: This file contains the records from every MLB game played from the 2016-2022 seasons.

Predicting_Wrigley.ipnyb: The Python notebook was built in Google Colab. Please note that the first cell with pip install may ask you to restart the runtime. Any error message will be fixed by restarting the runtime.
